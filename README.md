# Ask Her Out - Fun Interactive Web Page

## Overview
This is a fun and interactive web project designed to ask someone out in a playful way. It features a series of HTML pages with GIFs, a "Yes" and "No" button, and some dynamic behavior when the user hesitates.

## Features
- Interactive multiple-choice pathway to encourage a "Yes" response.
- Playful use of GIFs to enhance user engagement.
- A JavaScript script that moves the "No" button randomly on hover.
- A responsive and visually appealing UI with CSS styling.

## Files Included
- `index.html` - Main page asking the question with "Yes" and "No" buttons.
- `index1.html`, `index2.html`, `index3.html` - Additional playful pages encouraging a "Yes" answer.
- `yes.html` - The final acceptance page.
- `script.js` - JavaScript file that makes the "No" button move when hovered.
- `style.css` - Styling for the web pages.

## How It Works
1. The user is first asked the main question: "Will You Be My Valentine?"
2. If they click "Yes," they are taken to a confirmation page.
3. If they click "No," they are redirected to another page encouraging them to reconsider.
4. If they keep selecting "No," the button starts moving randomly, making it hard to decline.

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
